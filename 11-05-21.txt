javap is the tool to disassemble the .class file

javap -c <.class filename> is the command used to see bytecode in classfile.

javap -s <.class filename> is used to see internal method signatures

javap -l <.class filename> is used to display line numbers


javac <filename>.java - compiling the code
javap <.class filename> -disassemble the compiled code
java <.class filename> - to execute bytecode
