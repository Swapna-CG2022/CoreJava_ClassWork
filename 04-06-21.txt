anonymous class
================
 a class with out name is called as anonymous class
Anonymous class can be created using two ways:

1. using abstract or concrete class
2. using interface


Java 8 new features
===================

-From Java 8 we can add default and static methods to the interface,
 these are implemented methods in the interface.

- public static void main(String...args) 

- for each method in java 8
studentNameInitials.forEach(str -> {System.out.print("       "+str);});

-Method reference in java 8
System.out::println

Option class in Java 8
======================
it is used to solve the null pointer exception by return non null value.
Helper calss to check the presence of value for particular variable


Date/Time API in Java 8
=======================

LocalDate  => no time or timezone
LocalTime   => no date or timezone
LocalDateTime => date and time with out timezone

OffSetDate
offSetTime
offSetDateTime => + 5.30
ZoneId => chennai,kolkata 


Functional Interface=(SAM = Single Abstract Method interface)
=============================================================
An interface which contains only and only one abstract method then it is termed as functional interface.

@FunctionalInterface is used to specify on top of an interface to define it as functional interface

Runnable interface of java.lang package is functional interface it contains only one abstract method
run().

Upto Java 7 these Single Abstract Methods are implemented using anonymous classes.

From Java 8 we are implementing above SAM using Lambda Expressions.

Lambda Expressions practice
===========================
functional interface called multiplication 
with an abstract method mul()
and implement it using lambda expression

java.util.function => this package have set of predefined functional interfaces

Predicate
Consumer etc.,


Runnable interface using Lambda expression
=========================================
Stream API for Map collection
