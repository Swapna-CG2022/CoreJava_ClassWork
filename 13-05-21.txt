String in Java
==============

String is a predefined class in java from java.lang package

what is the default package imported by Java Compiler?
ans: java.lang

what is the super class(parent class) for all classes in java
?
ans : Object class
Object is defined in java.lang

String is a class used to store group of characters
Strings in java are constants means the value of strings cannot be changed
so, String objects are immutable(which doesnot allow to change the content inside it).

how to declare a string??
========================
1) String s = "this is a string"; //this creates an reference variable //stores in the stack ds
2) String str = new String();//this creates an empty string object //this is stored heap memory
3) char[] name = {'r','a','m','a'};
   String nameObj = new String(name);

class = Data members + methods 

string methods are extraction methods not modification of the strings

Object = Instance of class = copy of the class

Type of Methods
===============
Instance Methods => Methods which are accessed using the object name we call them as Instance Methods
Static Methods
Factory Methods


Method have 3 parts

1. Method signature
2. Method body
3. return type
